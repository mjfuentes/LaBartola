La Bartola Oficial
=========

Android application for an Argentinian cumbia band called "La Bartola".This apps uses Async tasks on startup to gather information from Facebook, Youtube, and RSS feeds.
After startup it displays a ViewPager with sections for News, Photos, Videos and info about the band.
It is a good example for new Android Developers on how to use ListViews, GridViews and ViewPagers, as well as Asyncs tasks for gathering information.


For image loading I used UniversalImageLoader(c) 2011-2014, Sergey Tarasevich.
